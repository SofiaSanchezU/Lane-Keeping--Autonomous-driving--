# Sumary.
This paper presents a comprehensive study on control strategies for addressing positioning errors in vehicle lane-keeping applications. The primary objective is to develop effective control techniques that can minimize the vehicle's positional error and ensure accurate lane keeping. Four control strategies, namely **𝑯∞** optimal control, **𝑯𝟐** optimal control, **𝑳𝟏** optimal control, and LPV gain schedule control were developed. To evaluate the effectiveness and performance of each control strategy in mitigating positioning errors and achieving robust and accurate lane-keeping capabilities were used simulations based on MATLAB/Simulink and Automated Driving Toolbox.
